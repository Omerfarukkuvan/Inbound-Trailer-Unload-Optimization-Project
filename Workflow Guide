# Workflow Guide: Data Visualization with Power BI

## Step 1: Prepare Data
1. Open the categorized Excel workbook containing pending and recovered delivery appointments.
2. Ensure the following columns are present for analysis:
   - Date (daily / weekly)
   - Trailer ID
   - Unload Duration (days)
   - Recovered Status
   - Average POGS (sales value)

## Step 2: Load Data into Power BI
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Select *Get Data â†’ Excel* and load the prepared workbook.
3. Confirm that all columns are correctly mapped and data types are accurate.

## Step 3: Create Visualizations

### Daily & Weekly Recovered Trailers
- Use a *Line Chart* for daily counts.
- Use a *Bar Chart* for weekly totals.
- Purpose: Monitor operational efficiency and identify trends over time.

### Unload Duration
- Use a *Histogram* or *Box Plot* to visualize unload time distribution.
- Purpose: Identify delays and outliers in unloading operations.

### Average POGS
- Use a *Line Chart* or *Area Chart* to track daily and weekly average sales value.
- Purpose: Measure financial impact and assess revenue trends.

## Step 4: Build Dashboard
1. Arrange the charts on a single dashboard for a comprehensive view.
2. Add *Filters / Slicers* for:
   - Date range
   - Yard
   - Trailer type
3. Apply *Conditional Formatting* for key metrics:
   - Highlight trailers exceeding unload time thresholds.
   - Mark days with unusually low recovered trailer counts.

## Step 5: Share Insights
- Export dashboards as PDF or publish to internal dashboards if allowed.
- Use visualizations to identify:
   - Yard congestion
   - Pending/unloaded trailers
   - Financial performance (POGS)
- Make operational recommendations based on insights.
