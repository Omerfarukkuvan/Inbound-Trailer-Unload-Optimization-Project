# Inbound-Trailer-Unload-Optimization-Project
A smart data-driven system to monitor and optimize inbound trailer operations, improving safety and reducing shipment defects.

# InboundIntelliTrack
Real-time tracking and analytics for safer, efficient inbound trailer operations.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to collect, analyze, and visualize inbound trailer data to minimize financial losses and yard congestion caused by unloaded trailers, ensure timely entry of goods into inventory, and develop a more efficient, reliable, and safe trailer tracking system.

## Features
- *Real-time Trailer Tracking:* Monitor inbound trailers in real time to ensure timely operations.
- *Unloaded Trailer Detection:* Identify trailers that have not been unloaded to prevent yard congestion.
- *Inventory Status Monitoring:* Track the entry of goods into inventory to reduce financial losses.
- *Yard Congestion Analysis:* Analyze yard space usage to optimize trailer placement and workflow.
- *Safety & Reject Monitoring:* Track safety compliance and detect trailers at risk of rejection.
- *Data Visualization & Reporting:* Visualize trailer and inventory data through dashboards and reports for actionable insights.
- *Stakeholder Communication:* Establish clear and reliable communication channels with all relevant parties.
- *Document Matching for Unload Verification:* Ensure all necessary documentation is matched to confirm trailer unloads.

## Technologies Used
- *Excel & CSV Files:* For data collection, organization, and preliminary analysis.
- *Internal Delivery Tracking Systems:* Generic delivery tracking and appointment systems (names anonymized).
- *Draw.io:* For process mapping and visualizing operational workflows.
- *Power BI:* For visualizing metrics, generating dashboards, and deriving actionable insights.

## Data Sources
- *Trailer Movement Records:* Inbound trailer tracking and appointment logs (anonymized).
- *Inventory Logs:* Status of goods entering inventory (sample data used).
- *Case Management Records:* Logs of operational cases and exceptions (sanitized).
- *Flat Files:* Excel/CSV extracts for reporting and ad-hoc analysis (anonymized samples).

- ## Installation / Setup
1. *Retrieve Delivery Appointment Data:* Extract pending delivery appointment records from the internal operational tracking system (anonymized for project use).  
2. *Prepare Categorized Workbook:* Organize the appointment data into a structured Excel workbook, categorizing entries as needed for analysis.  
3. *Save Excel Workbook:* Store the prepared workbook in the designated project folder for subsequent visualization and reporting.

## Usage
For detailed step-by-step instructions, refer to the [Workflow Guide](workflow/Workflow_Guide.md).

## Results / Outcomes
- Reduced yard congestion and ensured timely trailer unloading.
- Minimized financial losses by tracking inventory entry accurately.
- Improved safety compliance and reduced risk of rejected trailers.
- Enabled actionable insights through Power BI dashboards and visualizations.
- Established clear communication channels with relevant stakeholders.
